## MVP Scope

All 18 features are MVP. This is the minimum standard SDLC package that provides a complete graph from intent through UAT with convergence enforcement at every edge.

**Deferred** (V2+):
- Variant evolution model (REQ-F-VAR-*, REQ-F-PROV-* — proposed, not yet in Package registry)
- CI/CD and telemetry graph extensions
- Multi-agent coordination
- Package distribution via registry

## Module Mapping

The genesis_sdlc implementation consists of a single Python package. Features map to implementation modules as follows:

| Module | Primary Features | Key Functions |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| `install.py` | BOOT, BOOT-V2 | `install()`, `install_commands()`, `install_claude_md()`, `install_operating_standards()`, `_migrate_provenance()`, `_verify()` |
| `sdlc_graph.py` | GRAPH, MDECOMP | `package`, `worker`, `instantiate()` — the Package definition and all evaluators |
| `__init__.py` | — | Version and public exports |

**Supplementary** (not genesis_sdlc source — these are the abiogenesis engine, installed at `.genesis/`):
- `genesis/__main__.py` — CLI: `gen-start`, `gen-iterate`, `gen-gaps`, `emit-event`, `check-tags`, `check-*-coverage`
- `genesis/bind.py` — `bind_fd()`, `bind_fp()`, `bind_fh()`, evaluator execution
- `genesis/schedule.py` — `delta()`, `iterate()`, `schedule()`
- `genesis/commands.py` — `gen_gaps()`, `gen_iterate()`, `gen_start()`
- `genesis/core.py` — `emit()`, `project()`, `EventStream`, `ContextResolver`

## Feature Details

### REQ-F-GRAPH — SDLC Graph Definition

The GTL Package at `builds/python/src/genesis_sdlc/sdlc_graph.py` defines the typed asset graph. This is the constitutional source — all other features implement or enforce what the Package declares.

**Key artifacts**: 11 assets with markov conditions, 10 edges with evaluators (4 multi-source), operators (F_P, F_H, F_D), contexts per edge.

### REQ-F-BOOT — Project Bootstrap

The installer (`install.py`) copies the engine, generates config, creates workspace directories, and installs operating standards and commands. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

### REQ-F-BOOT-V2 — Three-Layer Install Architecture

Separates immutable methodology spec (`.gsdlc/release/spec/`), versioned release snapshot (`.gsdlc/release/workflows/genesis_sdlc/standard/v{VERSION}/`), and generated wrapper (`.gsdlc/release/gtl_spec/packages/`). The `.genesis/` directory contains only the ABG kernel. ADR-008 records the territory model.

### REQ-F-CMD — Engine Commands

Three commands as named compositions over engine functions. `gen-gaps` is pure observation. `gen-iterate` is one cycle. `gen-start` is the auto-loop.

### REQ-F-GATE — Human Approval Gates

F_H evaluators at spec/design boundaries. The ordering invariant (F_D→F_P→F_H) prevents wasted review. Proxy mode substitutes the LLM with audit trail.

### REQ-F-TAG — Traceability Tags

`# Implements: REQ-*` in source, `# Validates: REQ-*` in tests. Two F_D evaluators enforce presence. Pure grep — no LLM.

### REQ-F-COV — Coverage Enforcement

Every REQ key in Package.requirements must appear in at least one feature vector's `satisfies:` field. F_D check via `check-req-coverage`.

### REQ-F-TEST — Integration-Primary Test Surface

E2E and integration tests are the primary evidence surface. Unit tests supplement for write-primitive invariants only. `e2e_tests_exist` F_D enforces minimum.

### REQ-F-TEST-V2 — Test Version Sandboxing

F_D evaluator commands pin `PYTHONPATH=builds/python/src/:.genesis` so tests import from the release candidate source tree, not stale installs.

### REQ-F-UAT — Sandbox Proof Required to Ship

Unit tests alone do not satisfy UAT. Sandbox install + e2e run is the acceptance proof. No release without it.

### REQ-F-INT-003 — Integration Tests + User Guide as Graph Assets

Inserts `integration_tests` and `user_guide` as first-class assets between `unit_tests` and `uat_tests`. Separates deterministic sandbox proof from human judgment. User guide has F_D version/coverage checks.

### REQ-F-DOCS — User Documentation

`docs/USER_GUIDE.md` with install steps, first session walkthrough, command reference, operating loop, and recovery paths.

### REQ-F-BACKLOG — Pre-Intent Holding Area

`.ai-workspace/backlog/BL-*.yml` — ideas in gestation before formal intent. `gen backlog list` and `gen backlog promote` commands. Sensory system surfaces ready items.

### REQ-F-MDECOMP — Module Decomposition

Inserts `module_decomp` between `design` and `code`. Decomposes design into modules with dependency DAG and build order. F_H gate ensures schedule is approved before construction.

### REQ-F-CUSTODY — Requirements Custody

Fixes the critical bug where `instantiate()` hardcodes gsdlc's 33 REQ keys into every project. After this feature: `instantiate(slug, requirements=...)` accepts project-specific keys, the Layer 3 wrapper parses them from `specification/requirements/`, and the installer scaffolds the requirement surface for new projects. No-requirements-surface = empty list (zero requirements), never fallback to gsdlc's keys.

**Modules affected**: `sdlc_graph.py` (instantiate signature), `install.py` (wrapper template, scaffold)

### REQ-F-BOOTDOC — Bootloader as Compiled Graph Asset

Adds `bootloader` as the 11th graph asset — a compiled constraint surface synthesised from specification, standards, and design. Four F_D evaluators validate currency (spec hash, version, section coverage, reference validity). F_P regenerates from source documents. F_H approves. Leaf node — nothing depends on it.

**Modules affected**: `sdlc_graph.py` (new asset, edge E8, evaluators, contexts), `install.py` (bootloader generation on install)

### REQ-F-DAG-TOPO — DAG Topology with Relationship Type Separation

Rewires the graph from a linear pipeline to a clean DAG. Separates artifact lineage (creative input) from evidence prerequisites (convergence gates) in edge definitions. Removes co-evolve reflexive edge. Code and unit_tests become parallel derivations from module_decomp. User guide lineage changes to design. UAT decoupled from user guide.

**Modules affected**: `sdlc_graph.py` (edge rewiring, lineage changes, context reassignment, remove co_evolve), `install.py` (updated scaffolding if needed)
