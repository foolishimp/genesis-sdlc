# /gen-init - Initialize AI SDLC v2.8 Workspace

Initialize a project with the AI SDLC Asset Graph Model workspace structure.

<!-- Implements: REQ-TOOL-002 (Developer Workspace), REQ-TOOL-007 (Project Scaffolding), REQ-INTENT-001 (Intent Capture), REQ-INTENT-002 (Intent as Spec) -->

## Usage

```
/gen-init [--force] [--backup] [--impl "name"]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| (none) | Create missing files only (safe, default) |
| `--force` | Overwrite framework files (preserves user content) |
| `--backup` | Create backup before making changes |
| `--impl` | Implementation name (default: auto-detect from AI platform) |

## Instructions

This command scaffolds a v2.8 AI SDLC workspace: the asset graph configuration (Layer 2: Graph Package), context store and project constraints (Layer 3: Project Binding), feature tracking, and task management.

### Step 1: Determine Project Name and Implementation

Ask the user for the project name, or infer from:
- The current directory name
- An existing `package.json` name field
- An existing `pyproject.toml` name field

Determine the implementation name (`{impl}`):
- If `--impl` is provided, use it
- Otherwise auto-detect: `claude` for Claude Code, `gemini` for Gemini CLI, `codex` for Codex
- Ask to confirm

### Step 2: Create Directory Structure

Create these directories if they don't exist:

```
specification/                              # SHARED — tech-agnostic spec (root level)

imp_{impl}/                                 # Implementation (per-platform)
├── design/
│   └── adrs/                              # Architecture Decision Records
├── code/                                  # Implementation code
└── tests/                                 # Implementation tests

.ai-workspace/

├── intents/                # Captured intents

│   └── finished/           # Completed task docs
└── snapshots/              # Immutable session checkpoints
```

### Step 3: Copy Graph Topology Configuration

Copy the default graph topology files from the plugin into the workspace:

#### `.ai-workspace/graph/asset_types.yml`
Copy from plugin `v2/config/graph_topology.yml` — extract the `asset_types` section.

Actually, copy the entire `graph_topology.yml` as a single file:

#### `.ai-workspace/graph/graph_topology.yml`
Copy the plugin's `v2/config/graph_topology.yml` as the project's default graph topology.

#### `.ai-workspace/graph/evaluator_defaults.yml`
Copy the plugin's `v2/config/evaluator_defaults.yml`.

#### `.ai-workspace/graph/edges/`
Copy all files from the plugin's `v2/config/edge_params/` directory.

### Step 4: Scaffold Project Constraints

#### `.ai-workspace/{impl}/context/project_constraints.yml`

Copy from the plugin's `v2/config/project_constraints_template.yml` and auto-detect values:

1. **Project name**: from directory name, `package.json`, or `pyproject.toml`
2. **Language**: detect from file extensions, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`
3. **Test runner**: detect from `pyproject.toml` (pytest), `package.json` (jest/vitest), `Cargo.toml` (cargo test)
4. **Linter**: detect from `.ruff.toml`, `.eslintrc`, `rustfmt.toml`
5. **Formatter**: detect from `.prettierrc`, `.ruff.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`
6. **Type checker**: detect from `mypy.ini`, `tsconfig.json`

For any tool not auto-detected, leave the template default and add a comment:
```yaml
# TODO: Configure your test runner
```

7. **Constraint dimensions**: auto-populate from detected values:
   - `ecosystem_compatibility.language`: from detected language
   - `ecosystem_compatibility.version`: from detected version
   - `build_system.tool`: from detected build tool (npm, pip, sbt, cargo, etc.)
   - `build_system.module_structure`: "monolith" (default) or "multi-module" if detected
   - Mark remaining mandatory dimensions as `# TODO: Configure before running requirements→design edge`

Present the scaffolded file to the user for review before writing.

### Step 4b: Resolve Context Sources

After writing `project_constraints.yml`, read its `context_sources` array. For each entry:

1. **Resolve URI** to an absolute filesystem path:
   - `file:///path` → `/path`
   - `/absolute/path` → as-is
   - `../relative/path` → resolve relative to project root
2. **Validate** the path exists and is a directory
3. **Copy files** from the source into `.ai-workspace/{impl}/context/{scope}/`:
   - Copy all files (non-recursive for v1 — flat collection)
   - Prefix copied filenames with source identifier to avoid collisions:
     `{source-slug}__{original-filename}` (e.g., `org-standards__coding-style.md`)
   - Skip binary files, only copy `.md`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.txt`
4. **Add entries** to `.ai-workspace/{impl}/context/context_manifest.yml` with source URI and hash
5. **Report** what was copied, what was skipped, any errors

If a source path doesn't exist, warn but don't fail — the user may configure sources before the collections exist.

### Step 5: Copy Feature Vector Template and Projection Profiles

#### `.ai-workspace/features/feature_vector_template.yml`
Copy the plugin's `v2/config/feature_vector_template.yml` as the template for new feature vectors.

#### `.ai-workspace/profiles/`
Copy all files from the plugin's `v2/config/profiles/` directory (full.yml, standard.yml, poc.yml, spike.yml, hotfix.yml, minimal.yml). These are the named projection profiles that control graph subset, evaluator composition, convergence criteria, and context density.

#### `.ai-workspace/features/fold-back/`
Create the fold-back directory for child vector results that fold back to parent vectors.

#### `.ai-workspace/events/`
Create the events directory for the append-only event log. The iterate agent writes one JSON event per line to `events.jsonl` on every iteration. This is the **source of truth** — all other views (STATUS.md, ACTIVE_TASKS.md, feature vector trajectories) are derived projections of this event stream.

### Step 6: Create Context Manifest

#### `.ai-workspace/{impl}/context/context_manifest.yml`
```yaml
# AI SDLC Context Manifest — Spec Reproducibility
# Reference: REQ-INTENT-004
version: "1.0.0"
generated_at: "{timestamp}"
algorithm: "sha256-canonical-v1"

aggregate_hash: "pending"  # Computed on first /gen-checkpoint

entries: []  # Populated as context files are added
```

### Step 7: Create Feature Index

#### `.ai-workspace/features/feature_index.yml`
```yaml
# AI SDLC Feature Vector Index
version: "1.0.0"
project: "{project_name}"

active_features: []
completed_features: []

dependency_graph: {}
```

### Step 8: Create Active Tasks

#### `.ai-workspace/tasks/active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md`
```markdown
# Active Tasks

**Project**: {project_name}
**Methodology**: AI SDLC Asset Graph Model v2.8
**Last Updated**: {date}

## Summary

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| In Progress | 0 |
| Pending | 0 |
| Blocked | 0 |

## Tasks

No tasks yet. Start by capturing your intent.

---

## Recently Completed

None yet.
```

### Step 9: Create Named Compositions Directory and README (NC-006)

Create `.ai-workspace/named_compositions/` directory.

Write `.ai-workspace/named_compositions/README.md`:

```markdown
# Project-Local Named Compositions

This directory contains project-local named compositions that shadow the library entries
in `config/named_compositions.yml` by `{name, version}`.

## Shadow Rule

When the system loads compositions (`load_named_compositions()`), library entries are
loaded first. Project-local entries with the same `{name, version}` key override them.
Shadowing is logged as an `intent_raised` event with `gap_type: local_composition_shadow`
to make overrides auditable.

## Adding a Composition

To add a project-local composition:

1. Create a YAML file in this directory (e.g., `my_composition_v1.yml`)
2. Use the schema from `config/named_compositions.yml` as a guide
3. Run `/gen-iterate --edge "intent → named_composition"` to put the composition
   through the REVIEW gate (single human approval)
4. On approval, the composition becomes active immediately for this project

## Promoting to Library

To promote a composition to the shared library (accessible across all projects):

1. Run `/gen-iterate --edge "intent → named_composition" --profile full`
2. This invokes the CONSENSUS functor (REQ-F-CONSENSUS-001) — a multi-party quorum votes
3. On `consensus_reached`, the composition is merged into `config/named_compositions.yml`
   via a `spec_modified` event

## File Format

```yaml
# my_composition_v1.yml
compositions:
  - name: MY_COMPOSITION
    version: v1
    scope: project-local
    governance: review  # review | consensus
    description: "What this composition does"
    parameters:
      - name: param1
        type: string
        required: true
    output_type: result_type
    body:
      - functor: SOME_FUNCTOR
        args: {key: value}
```
```

### Step 10: Create Intent Placeholder

#### `specification/INTENT.md`
```markdown
# Project Intent

**Project**: {project_name}
**Date**: {date}
**Status**: Draft

---

## INT-001: {Project Name} Initial Intent

### Problem / Opportunity

{Describe the problem or opportunity here}

### Expected Outcomes

- [ ] Outcome 1
- [ ] Outcome 2

### Constraints

- Constraint 1

---

## Next Steps

1. Refine this intent with stakeholders
2. Run `/gen-iterate --edge "intent→requirements"` to generate REQ-* keys
3. Review and approve requirements
```

### Step 10: Create ADR Template

#### `imp_{impl}/design/adrs/ADR-000-template.md`
```markdown
# ADR-000: Template

**Status**: Template (copy and rename to create new ADR)
**Date**: {date}

## Context

{What forces are at play? What problem or decision are we facing?}

## Decision

We will {describe decision here}.

## Rationale

{Why this decision over alternatives?}

### Alternatives Considered

1. **{Alternative 1}**: rejected because {reason}
2. **{Alternative 2}**: rejected because {reason}

## Consequences

### Positive
- {Positive consequence}

### Negative
- {Negative consequence}

## Requirements Addressed

- REQ-*: {requirement description}
```

### Step 11: Emit Event

Append a `project_initialized` event to `.ai-workspace/events/events.jsonl`:

```json
{"event_type": "project_initialized", "timestamp": "{ISO 8601}", "project": "{project_name}", "data": {"language": "{detected language}", "tools_detected": ["{test_runner}", "{linter}", "..."], "constraint_dimensions_configured": {count of non-empty mandatory dimensions}, "asset_types": {count from graph_topology}, "transitions": {count from graph_topology}}}
```

Create the `.ai-workspace/events/` directory and `events.jsonl` file if they don't exist yet.

### Step 12: Report Results
